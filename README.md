# Modular Type
A tool for creating kinetic typography that explores procedural animation using waveforms.

## About
Motion Graphics are often created using applications such as Cinema4D or Adobe After Effects. Although powerful, these applications can require long render times and heavy amounts of iteration. The purpose of Modular Type was to create a playful animation tool where users can experiment, see changes live, and produce visually pleasing kinetic typography.
