# About

Motion graphics are often created using software such as Cinema4d or Adobe After Effects. These applications are extremely powerful but can be somewhat difficult to harness, and lack the ability for users to experiment and create animation with total control. 

With a particular vision in mind, I wanted to create my own tool for generating motion graphics that would allow users to tweak settings and see changes live - no render times.

The application uses openframeworks, an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding.
